<h1>Dummy new tab page</h1>
<p>If you put other things in this directory (like css), your page can successfully reference them.</p>
<p>By default, your new tab page must be named homepage.html and put in the newtab-page/ directory, but you can change that in the manifest.json under the "newtab" key.</p>
